# Epic: Tool System & Registry

Implement tools/registry.ts (Zod→OpenAI schema conversion, tool registration, argument validation per SHARP_EDGES.md, parallel execution). Then implement all ~115 tools across categories: files, git, shell, web, notes, location, places, media, steam, music, recipes, wiki, academic, stack, calendar, alarms, ntfy, spotify, maps, github, coding, system, tickets. Each tool category is a separate file that self-registers.
