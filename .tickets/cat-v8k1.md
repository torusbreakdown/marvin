# Node.js Marvin Rewrite Epic

Rewrite Marvin as production-grade Node.js/TypeScript with exact API compatibility. Includes all 70+ tools, multi-provider LLM support, retro terminal UI, and design-first pipeline. Acceptance criteria: CLI flags match Python version, stdout format identical, stderr emits MARVIN_COST JSON, path security enforced, ticket gating works, retro UI with vaporwave aesthetic.
