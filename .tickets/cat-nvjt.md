# Phase 2: Write Failing Tests (TDD)

Write comprehensive test suite for all modules before implementation. Tests must fail initially (RED phase). Cover: CLI argument parsing, tool registry, LLM providers, file operations, git operations, path security, pipeline state management. Follow no-mock policy - use real implementations and temp directories.
