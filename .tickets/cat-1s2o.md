# Greenfield marvin-web (design-first TDD)

Build marvin-web from scratch in /home/kmd/marvin-web per requirements: full-screen chat UI w/ SSE streaming, markdown + syntax highlighting, conversation management sidebar w/ SQLite persistence and search, status bar, settings panel, error handling, accessible, fast, no CDN. Use design_first=true and tdd=true to generate .marvin/spec.md and .marvin/design.md, then implement with tests.
